Course Highlights
• Learn to design A/B tests
• Conduct power analysis
• Calculate sample sizes manually.
• Interpret A/B test results
• including p-values
• sample size standard error
• pooled variance
• confidence intervals
• Understand the generalizability and
reproducibility of your A/B test results.

A/B testing or split testing 
* Control Group ( Exposed to current version)
* Experimental Group (Exposed to new version)
- Check out if there is a difference in performance of the product

A/B testing process
1. Stating the Hypothesis of A/B Test
2. A/B Test Design | Power Analysis
3. Run the A/B Test
4. Results Analysis | Statistical Significance
5. Results Analysis | Practical Significance

Primary Metric is a way to measure the performance of the product being tested in the A/B test, for the experimental and control groups. It will be used to identify whether there is a statistically significant difference between these two groups.

Choosing Primary Metric
Metric Validity Question: If this chosen metric were to increase significantly while everything else stays constant, would we achieve our goal and address the problem?
• higher revenue?
• higher engagement?
• more views?

Revenue Primary Metric
Conversion rate = (Number of conversions / Number of total visitors) x 100%

Engagement Primary Metric
CTR = (Number of clicks / Number of impressions) x 100%

2. A/B Test Design
	1. Power Analysis
	2. Minimum sample size
	3. Test Duration

Power Analysis
1. Determine Power of the test
• probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis
• probability of not making a type II error (1-ß)
• B: Type Il error
• common to pick 80% as the power of the A/B test

2. Determine Significance Level of the test
• probability of rejecting the null, while the null is true
• detecting statistically significance while it's not
• probability of making a type I error (a)
• common to pick 5% as significance level of the test


3. Determine Minimum Detectable Effect of the test
• What is the substantive to the statistical significance for business?
• Proxy that relates to smallest effect that would matter in practice
• No common level → depends on the business ask
